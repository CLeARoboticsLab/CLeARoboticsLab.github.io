Jingqi is a postdoctoral researcher at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor David Fridovich-Keil. His research lies at the intersection of dynamic game theory, control, and reinforcement learning, where he develops theoretical and practical methods to advance agentsâ€™ strategic reasoning and enable coordination in complex, uncertain scenarios. His work spans applications such as autonomous driving, air mobility, multi-robot manipulation, and smart grids. 

Prior to UT Austin, he earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2025, advised by Professors Claire Tomlin and Somayeh Sojoudi.
