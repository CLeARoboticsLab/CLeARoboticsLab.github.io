[Brett Barkley](https://bebark.github.io/) is a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin advised by David Fridovich-Keil. Brett's research interest focuses on methods that promote waste minimization in the lifecycle of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically the 3 Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. 

Before enrolling at UT, Brett was an employee of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory where he was the sub and full-scale aircraft red team autonomy lead for [DARPA ACE](https://www.darpa.mil/program/air-combat-evolution#:~:text=The%20ACE%20program%20seeks%20to,into%20complex%20human%2Dmachine%20collaboration.). Brett holds a BS and MS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland and a BS in Engineering Physics from Elon University. Outside of research, Brett enjoys being a hobbyist in brazilian jiu jitsu, playing video games with friends, and eating entirely too much [H-E-B queso](https://www.heb.com/product-detail/h-e-b-queso-classic-mild/2088339).
