[Jacob Levy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-j-levy/) is a Master's and PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. Jake is interested in developing algorithms for robotic systems which learn from past experiences to adapt to changing dynamics and unseen environments. This includes research in machine learning (ML), reinforcement learning (RL), and adaptation techniques which will enable effective real-world performance where only uncertain dynamics models of the system and environment are available.  

Prior to enrolling at UT Austin, Jake worked for 10 years at Parker Aerospace in Fort Worth, TX. His previous roles include Engineering Test Lab Manager and Test Engineer. Jake completed his B.S. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington.
