Xinjie is a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/), [Cockrell School of Engineering](https://cockrell.utexas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). He is very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [David Fridovich-Keil](https://dfridovi.github.io/) and Prof. [Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). His research interests lie in developing decision-making and control strategies for autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. He is currently focused on intelligent, safe interactions of robots with other agents and efficient robot control policy learning. 

Xinjie obtained a master's degree (the highest cum laude distinction) in Robotics from the [Department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), Netherlands, where he was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Javier Alonso-Mora](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/). His master's thesis was on game-theoretic motion planning for multi-agent systems. Before that, He received his bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), Shanghai. During his senior year, he studied as a visiting undergraduate student at the [Graz Univerisity of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/), Austria.
