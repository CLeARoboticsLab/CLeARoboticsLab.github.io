### About us
We are a group of scientists and engineers working at the intersection between robotics, control theory, machine learning, and game theory to design high performance, interactive autonomous systems. Our lab is based in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics](https://www.ae.utexas.edu) and the [Robotics Consortium at UT Austin](https://robotics.utexas.edu).

### Research
Some of our lab's core research interests are:

- posing interactive motion planning problems as multi-player, noncooperative dynamic games and designing efficient algorithms to solve them
- inferring properties of game-theoretic interactions, such as equilibrium type, player objectives, and constraints
- building a rapprochement between machine learning methods and classical techniques for robust, adaptive, and geometric control

### Lab Members

Our group started in August 2021. Visit our [people page](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/people/) for profiles of lab members.
