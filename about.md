### About us
We are a group of control theorists and roboticists working at the intersection between control theory, machine learning, and game theory to design high performance, interactive autonomous robots.

### Research
Some of our lab's core research interests are:

- posing interactive motion planning problems as multi-player, noncooperative dynamic games and designing efficient algorithms to solve them
- inferring properties of game-theoretic interactions, such as equilibrium type, player objectives, and constraints
- building a rapprochement between machine learning methods and classical techniques for robust, adaptive, and geometric control

### Lab Members

Our group is just getting started. Visit our [people page](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/people/) for profiles of lab members.
