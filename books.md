### Smooth Game Theory

This monograph accompanies the graduate class _ASE 389: Game-Theoretic Modeling of Multi-Agent Systems_ at UT Austin. It provides a general overview of both static and dynamic games, with a focus on developing an optimization-oriented perspective for defining---and solving for---equilibria of games in which players have differentiable objectives and constraints.

A preprint is available [here](/documents/smooth-game-theory.pdf), and below:
